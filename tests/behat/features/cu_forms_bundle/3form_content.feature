  Scenario Outline: Node Access - Some roles can add Webform content
    Given I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
    When I go to "node/add/webform"
    Then I should see <message>

    Examples:
      | role            | message          |

      | edit_my_content | "Access denied"  |
      | site_editor     | "Access denied" |
      | edit_only       | "Access denied"  |
    #  | form_manager    | "Create Webform" |
