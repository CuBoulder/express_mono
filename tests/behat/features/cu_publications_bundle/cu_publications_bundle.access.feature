Feature: Issue Node Type
When I login to a Web Express website
As an authenticated user with the right permission
I should be able to create an Issue

Scenario Outline: An authenticated user should be able to access the form for adding an issue
  Given  I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
  When I go to "node/add/issue"
  Then I should see <message>

  Examples:
  | role            | message         |
  | edit_my_content | "Access Denied" |
  | edit_only       | "Access Denied" |
  | content_editor  | "Create Issue"  |
  | site_owner      | "Create Issue"  |
  | administrator   | "Create Issue"  |
  | developer       | "Create Issue"  |

Scenario: An anonymous user should not be able to access the form for adding an issue
  When I am on "node/add/issue"
  Then I should see "Access denied"
