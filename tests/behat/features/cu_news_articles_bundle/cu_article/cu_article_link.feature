Feature: Article Read More Links

Scenario: An issue page should contain articles with a single read more link
 Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
  And I am on "node/add/article"
  And fill in "edit-title" with "Test Article One"
  And fill in "Body" with "This is some body text"
  When I press "edit-submit"
 Then I should see "Article Test Article One has been created."
 Then I go to "node/add/article"
  And fill in "edit-title" with "Test Article Two"
  And fill in "Body" with "This is some body text"
  When I press "edit-submit"
 Then I should see "Article Test Article Two has been created."
 Then I go to "article-tests"
