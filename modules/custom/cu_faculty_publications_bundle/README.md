**NOTE: To update this repository's codebase, please read: [Releasing Custom Bundle Code](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express_documentation/blob/master/docs/creating_custom_bundles.md#releasing-custom-bundle-code).**

The cu_alumni_class_notes_bundle adds a new block type to display faculty research publications.

_This is very much just a prototype and only supports displaying blocks via content when the FIS Id is configured on the Person pages._
